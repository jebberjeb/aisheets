This decision matrix contains a wealth of information pertaining to the implementation details and trade-offs between different solutions for handling ingestion pipelines in the PromETL system. While the matrix broadly covers a range of considerations, from operational costs to alignment with organizational goals, there are opportunities for improvement, especially regarding the clarity and structuring of criteria. Below are suggestions for refining the matrix:

### Recommendations for General Improvement
- **Simplify Criteria Descriptions**: Some of the criteria are explained with extensive details within the decision matrix cells. It would be beneficial to distill these into more concise statements. For more elaborate explanations, consider an appendix or supplementary document.
- **Clarify Ambiguous Terminology**: Terms like "good", "medium", and "bad" are subjective and could lead to misinterpretation. Quantify or qualify these terms where possible.
- **Uniformity in Measurement**: Ensure consistency in how outcomes are measured or described across different criteria to make comparison easier. For instance, use a consistent cost measurement unit across all relevant criteria.

### Specific Feedback and Refinements

1. **Criteria Refinement**:
    - "Overall performance" is vaguely defined. Break this down into more specific, measurable criteria such as "Processing Latency" and "Throughput".
    - "Efficiency" criteria could benefit from further breakdown into "Resource Utilization Efficiency" and "Cost Efficiency" to provide a more nuanced comparison.
    - The "maintenance cost" criterion should specify whether it refers to financial cost, time investment, or both.
    - "Operational ownership of pipelines" and "ownership of ingestion dataset" seem to overlap with "Alignment with overall governance and ownership strategy in data". Consider consolidating these into a single, more comprehensive criterion or explicitly differentiate them.

2. **Add Missing Criteria**:
    - **Security**: While some aspects like isolation touch upon security considerations implicitly, explicitly including security as a criterion (e.g., "Data Security and Compliance") might highlight important trade-offs between solutions.
    - **Scalability**: The term "scalability (e.g., ouroboros)" could be clarified. Specific scalability aspects, like "Horizontal Scalability" and "Vertical Scalability", could provide clearer guidance.
    - **User Experience**: This is mentioned, but can be expanded upon. "User Operational Complexity" could be a valuable addition, considering how the different solutions might require different levels of engagement from the teams involved.

3. **Criteria Structure**:
    - Avoid nesting multiple aspects within a single criterion. For example, "Recovery after crash/incident with PromETL" encompasses several potential evaluation metrics (e.g., time to recovery, ease of recovery process). Breaking complex criteria into simpler, more focused criteria can improve clarity.
    - Ensure each criterion is directly relevant to the overarching goal of defining the cardinality of ingestion pipelines. Some criteria seem to address broader organizational or operational issues that, although important, may dilute the focus on selecting the optimal pipeline configuration.

4. **Enhance Comparability**:
    - For criteria like cloud and operational costs, explicitly state assumptions or provide formulas for cost calculations to enhance comparability between solutions.
    - Where "IT DEPENDS" is used, identify specific factors or conditions that influence the outcome to guide decision-making more effectively.

By addressing these areas, the decision matrix would not only become more legible and useful for stakeholders but also facilitate a more objective and comprehensive evaluation of the proposed solutions against the stated problem.
