To improve the Decision Matrix (DM) related to the PromETL system, consider applying the following adjustments:

**Clarify Ambiguous Terms and Metrics**

- **Overall Performance**: Instead of stating "WHAT IS PERFORMANCE?" and providing vague ratings like "bad" or "medium", specify what dimensions constitute performance for PromETL. Break it down into measurable components such as "processing latency" or "throughput".

```markdown
For instance:
- Processing Latency: How quickly can each pipeline process a dataset?
- Throughput: How much data can each pipeline handle in a given timeframe?
```

- **Efficiency and Scalability**: The "efficiency" criterion is subjective. Define efficiency in terms of resource utilization, cost per dataset ingested, or another quantitative metric. Similarly, clarify how scalability is evaluatedâ€”does it refer to the ability to handle increased data volumes, more indicators, or something else? Provide numerical targets or ranges for both.

```markdown
Example criteria refinement:
- Resource Utilization Efficiency: Percentage of resources used against resources allocated.
- Scalability: Ability to increase ingestion pipeline capacity by X% without significant performance degradation or increased costs.
```

**Objective and Quantifiable Criteria**

- **Maintenance and Operational Costs**: These criteria mention "higher", "medium", and "lowest" without explaining what these classifications mean in terms of time, money, or resource investment. Specify the expected maintenance hours per week or maintenance costs per month for each solution.

```markdown
Suggested amendment:
- Maintenance Cost: Estimated monthly cost (in USD) for maintaining each pipeline solution.
```

- **Cloud Cost for Ingestion**: You've done well to provide numerical values here. Ensure consistency across all numerical criteria by making clear any assumptions behind these estimations.

**Consolidate Overlapping Criteria**

- **Pipeline Ownership and Operational Ownership of Pipelines**: These criteria seem to overlap. Consider combining them into a single, clarified criterion that specifies what dimensions of ownership are being evaluated (e.g., decision-making authority, financial responsibility, operational maintenance).

**Increase Comparability Across Solutions**

- **User Experience**: Break down the "User Experience" into measurable components like "setup time" or "ease of use" rated on a standardized scale. Avoid broad statements such as "Poor" or "Very good" without clear, consistent standards.

```markdown
More detailed criteria:
- Setup Time: Average time (in hours) required to integrate a new indicator into the pipeline.
- Ease of Use: Rated on a scale from 1 (Not Intuitive) to 5 (Very Intuitive).
```

**Clarify TBD and Mixed Ratings**

- For criteria labeled as "TBD" or "IT DEPENDS", determine if additional research or assumptions could allow for more concrete ratings. If the variability is due to external factors, clarify these conditions.

```markdown
For example:
- If "Efficiency" varies, provide scenarios or a range of expected efficiencies based on known factors.
```

**Define the Legend Clearly**

- The legend at the end of the matrix mentions descriptors like "Desirable / Good / Benefit" but is not utilized effectively within the table. Explicitly connect these descriptors to specific criteria within the matrix to facilitate easier interpretation.

**Incorporate Additional Criteria**

- Consider adding criteria related to:
  - **Environmental Impact**: If applicable, evaluate the carbon footprint of each solution.
  - **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements**: How well does each solution adhere to relevant laws and regulations?

```markdown
New criteria examples:
- Environmental Impact: Estimated CO2 emissions per TB of data processed.
- Compliance: Degree of adherence to GDPR, CCPA, etc., rated on a scale of 1 (Non-Compliant) to 5 (Fully Compliant).
```

By incorporating these adjustments, you can enhance the clarity, relevance, and objectivity of your decision matrix, facilitating a more informed and justifiable decision-making process regarding the PromETL system's ingestion pipelines.
